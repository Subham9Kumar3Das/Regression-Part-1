    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to understand and predict the relationship between two variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (outcome). In simple terms, it helps you find a straight line that best fits your data points. This line can be used to make predictions based on the independent variable.\n",

    "Imagine you want to predict a person's weight (dependent variable) based on their height (independent variable). In this case, you're looking for a linear relationship between height and weight. Simple linear regression will help you find the best-fitting line to predict someone's weight based on their height.\n",

    "Suppose you want to predict a house's price (dependent variable), and you believe it depends on not only the number of bedrooms (independent variable) but also the square footage of the house (another independent variable) and the neighborhood's safety rating (a third independent variable). Multiple linear regression would help you find the best-fitting equation that takes all these factors into account to predict the house price."

    "2. Independence: The residuals (the differences between the actual data points and the predicted values) should be independent of each other. This means that one data point's residual should not influence the residual of another data point. You can check this by examining a plot of the residuals over time or in any other relevant order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: This assumption means that the spread or variance of the residuals should be roughly the same across all values of the independent variables. You can check this by creating a plot of residuals versus predicted values. If the spread of points in the plot widens or narrows as you move along the predicted values, homoscedasticity may not hold.\n",
